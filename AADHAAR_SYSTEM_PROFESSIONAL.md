# 🐄 Professional Gomata Aadhaar System

## Overview

This is a **professional cattle identification system** modeled after India's human Aadhaar system, providing unique 12-digit identification numbers for cows.

---

## ✅ FIXED: Proper Aadhaar ID Implementation

### What Was Wrong:
- ❌ Using folder names as IDs (e.g., "s1868", "Training")
- ❌ Not professional or standardized
- ❌ Folder names are meaningless for identification

### What's Fixed Now:
- ✅ **Proper 12-digit Aadhaar IDs** (e.g., `2847 5639 1024`)
- ✅ **Formatted display** (XXXX XXXX XXXX)
- ✅ **Follows Aadhaar standards** (first digit 2-9, not 0 or 1)
- ✅ **Folder name tracked separately** in notes field
- ✅ **Clear error reporting** for failed enrollments

---

## 🎯 Aadhaar ID Format

### Generation Rules:
```
Format: XXXX XXXX XXXX (12 digits)
Example: 2847 5639 1024

Rules:
- First digit: 2-9 (never 0 or 1, as per Aadhaar standards)
- Remaining 11 digits: 0-9 (random)
- Total: 12 digits
- Unique for each cow
```

### Display Format:
```
Storage: "284756391024" (no spaces)
Display: "2847 5639 1024" (with spaces for readability)
```
