# Quick Start - Enroll Your 42 Cows

## TL;DR
1. ‚úÖ Check "Skip duplicate detection" in Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Upload your 42 folders (6 images each)
3. ‚úÖ Export the dataset
4. ‚úÖ Place in `public/dataset/cows-dataset.json`
5. ‚úÖ Deploy!

## Why You Were Getting Duplicates

The AI was being too cautious and matching different cows of the same breed. 

**Fixed by:**
- Raising confidence threshold to 95%
- Improving AI prompt to look for unique features
- Adding option to skip duplicate checking
